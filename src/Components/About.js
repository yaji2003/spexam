            This floor plan example represent the food court furniture layout.
  "A food court (in Asia-Pacific also called food hall) is generally an indoor plaza or common area within a facility that is contiguous with the counters of multiple food vendors and provides a common area for self-serve dinner.
  Food courts may be found in shopping malls, airports, and parks. In various regions (such as Asia, the Americas, and Africa), it may be a standalone development. In some places of learning such as high schools and universities, food courts have also come to replace or complement traditional cafeterias." [Food court. Wikipedia]
  The floor plan example "Food court" was created using ConceptDraw PRO diagramming and vector drawing software extended with the Floor Plans solution from the Building Plans area of ConceptDraw Solution Park.
